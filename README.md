## About The Project

A challenge to myself to redesign my favorite brewery's online store, [Modern Times Brewery](https://www.moderntimesmerch.com/collections/all) , and use Sanity.io as the CMS (content management system) to manage the store's inventory and blog posts and Stripe for checkout.

### Highlights

- Responsive, full-stack, Next.js ecommerce application
- Browse coffee and beer products, view product details, add to cart, and checkout
- Stripe integration for processing payments, shipping rates, and checkout process.
- CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations are handled by Sanity's Studio
- Blog posts can be written in markdown using Sanity's Markdown plugin
